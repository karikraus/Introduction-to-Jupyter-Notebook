    "The Jupyter notebook is a browser-based coding environment that supports integration of executable code with text, images, video, and other media. The interface evokes the old-school, spiralbound notebooks of our youth, but instead of wide-ruled lines for guiding handwriting, the unit or space of composition is the cell. There are two main types of cells: code cells and markdown cells. Code cells, as the name suggests, are dedicated to code, while markdown cells contain text. \"Markdown\" denotes a lightweight descriptive language, similar to HTML/CSS, that specifies how text should be formatted. This cell, for example--the one you're reading right now--contains markdown that instructs the browser to display the header in a larger font than the rest of the text. If you place your cursor in this cell and double click, you'll be able to see the markdown code, which consists of a single hashmark in front of the section title, \"What is Jupyter Notebook?\" You can also embed HTML code to supplement markdown. I've specified the font style and size using HTML tags, which are likewise visible by double clicking inside the cell.</span>"
